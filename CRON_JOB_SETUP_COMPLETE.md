# ✅ Cron Job Setup Complete!

## 🎉 What's Been Configured

Your email automation cron job is now fully set up and will run automatically every day at 9:00 AM.

---

## 🔐 Security Configuration

**Environment Variable Added:**
```bash
EMAIL_AUTOMATION_SECRET=08bfe772accdc2001f006a798e23247604d1cc0846fb08c9b15674af80a89e81
```

This secret has been:
- ✅ Added to your `.env.local` file
- ✅ Added to `env.example` as a template
- ✅ Configured in `vercel.json` for automatic cron execution

**⚠️ IMPORTANT:** Never commit this secret to version control! It's already in `.env.local` which should be in your `.gitignore`.

---

## ⏰ Cron Job Schedule

**File:** `vercel.json`

```json
{
  "crons": [
    {
      "path": "/api/emails/automation?secret=$EMAIL_AUTOMATION_SECRET&type=all",
      "schedule": "0 9 * * *"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Schedule:** Every day at 9:00 AM UTC
- **Credit warnings**: Sent to users with ≤2 credits
- **Re-engagement**: Sent to users inactive for 14, 30, or 60 days
- **Performance summaries**: Sent every Monday to active users

---

## 🚀 Deployment Options

### Option 1: Vercel (Automatic) ⭐ **RECOMMENDED**

The cron job is already configured in `vercel.json` and will work automatically when you deploy to Vercel.

**Steps:**
1. Deploy to Vercel: `vercel deploy`
2. Set environment variable in Vercel dashboard:
   ```
   EMAIL_AUTOMATION_SECRET=08bfe772accdc2001f006a798e23247604d1cc0846fb08c9b15674af80a89e81
   ```
3. Done! Vercel will automatically run the cron job daily at 9 AM

**Vercel Dashboard:**
- Go to: Project Settings → Environment Variables
- Add: `EMAIL_AUTOMATION_SECRET` with the value above
- Redeploy for changes to take effect

---

### Option 2: System Cron (Linux/Mac)

If you're running on a server, set up a system cron job:

```bash
# Open crontab
crontab -e

# Add this line (runs at 9 AM every day):
0 9 * * * curl -X GET "https://yourdomain.com/api/emails/automation?secret=08bfe772accdc2001f006a798e23247604d1cc0846fb08c9b15674af80a89e81&type=all" > /dev/null 2>&1
```

---

### Option 3: GitHub Actions

Create `.github/workflows/email-automation.yml`:

```yaml
name: Email Automation
on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 9 * * *'  # 9 AM UTC daily
  workflow_dispatch:  # Manual trigger

jobs:
  send-emails:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Trigger Email Automation
        run: |
          curl -X GET "https://yourdomain.com/api/emails/automation?secret=${{ secrets.EMAIL_AUTOMATION_SECRET }}&type=all"
```

Then add `EMAIL_AUTOMATION_SECRET` to GitHub Secrets.

---

### Option 4: AWS CloudWatch Events

```bash
# Create CloudWatch Events rule
aws events put-rule \
  --name daily-email-automation \
  --schedule-expression "cron(0 9 * * ? *)"

# Add target (Lambda or HTTP endpoint)
aws events put-targets \
  --rule daily-email-automation \
  --targets "Id"="1","Arn"="your-lambda-arn"
```

---

### Option 5: Manual Trigger (For Testing)

You can manually trigger the automation anytime:

```bash
curl -X GET "http://localhost:3000/api/emails/automation?secret=08bfe772accdc2001f006a798e23247604d1cc0846fb08c9b15674af80a89e81&type=all"
```

**Or trigger specific types:**

```bash
# Only credit warnings
curl -X GET "http://localhost:3000/api/emails/automation?secret=YOUR_SECRET&type=credit_warning"

# Only re-engagement
curl -X GET "http://localhost:3000/api/emails/automation?secret=YOUR_SECRET&type=reengagement"

# Only performance summaries
curl -X GET "http://localhost:3000/api/emails/automation?secret=YOUR_SECRET&type=performance"
```

---

## 🧪 Testing the Cron Job

### Test Locally:

```bash
# Start your dev server
npm run dev

# In another terminal, trigger the automation:
curl -X GET "http://localhost:3000/api/emails/automation?secret=08bfe772accdc2001f006a798e23247604d1cc0846fb08c9b15674af80a89e81&type=all"
```

**Expected Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "creditWarnings": 5,
  "reengagement": 3,
  "summaries": 0
}
```

---

## 📊 Monitoring

### Check Sent Emails in Database:

```sql
-- View recent automation emails
SELECT 
  u.email,
  e.email_type,
  e.sent_at,
  e.status,
  e.metadata
FROM email_automation_log e
JOIN users u ON e.user_id = u.id
ORDER BY e.sent_at DESC
LIMIT 50;
```

### Check Vercel Logs:

```bash
vercel logs --follow
```

Or in Vercel Dashboard:
- Go to: Your Project → Logs
- Filter by: `/api/emails/automation`

---

## 🔄 Modifying the Schedule

Edit `vercel.json` to change when emails are sent:

```json
{
  "crons": [
    {
      "path": "/api/emails/automation?secret=$EMAIL_AUTOMATION_SECRET&type=all",
      "schedule": "0 8 * * *"  // Change to 8 AM
    }
  ]
}
```

**Cron Schedule Examples:**
- `0 9 * * *` - Every day at 9 AM
- `0 */6 * * *` - Every 6 hours
- `0 9 * * 1` - Every Monday at 9 AM
- `0 9,15 * * *` - Every day at 9 AM and 3 PM
- `*/30 * * * *` - Every 30 minutes

**⚠️ Note:** After changing, redeploy to Vercel for changes to take effect.

## 🛡️ Security Best Practices

### ✅ Do's:
- ✅ Keep your secret in environment variables
- ✅ Use a strong, random secret (32+ characters)
- ✅ Rotate the secret every 3-6 months
- ✅ Monitor failed authentication attempts
- ✅ Use HTTPS in production

### ❌ Don'ts:
- ❌ Don't commit secrets to Git
- ❌ Don't share secrets in Slack/Discord
- ❌ Don't use simple/guessable secrets
- ❌ Don't expose the secret in client-side code
- ❌ Don't log the secret value

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Cron Not Running?

**On Vercel:**
1. Check environment variables are set
2. Check deployment logs
3. Verify cron is enabled (Hobby plan has limits)
4. Check project settings → Cron Jobs

**System Cron:**
1. Check cron logs: `tail -f /var/log/cron.log`
2. Test the URL manually with curl
3. Verify cron service is running: `systemctl status cron`

### Unauthorized Errors?

```json
{ "error": "Unauthorized" }
```

**Solutions:**
- Check the secret in your environment variables
- Verify the secret in the URL matches `.env.local`
- Make sure the secret is set in Vercel dashboard
- Try redeploying after adding the secret

### No Emails Being Sent?

**Check:**
1. Are there users eligible for emails? (Run SQL queries in docs)
2. Have emails been sent in the last 7 days? (Check `email_automation_log`)
3. Is Resend API key valid?
4. Check the automation logs in console

## 📈 Expected Email Volume

Based on your user base:

| Users | Credit Warnings/Day | Re-engagement/Day | Performance/Week |
|-------|---------------------|-------------------|------------------|
| 100   | 2-5                 | 1-3               | 20-30            |
| 1,000 | 20-50               | 10-30             | 200-300          |
| 10,000| 200-500             | 100-300           | 2,000-3,000      |

**⚠️ Important:** 
- Resend free tier: 100 emails/day, 3,000/month
- Upgrade to paid plan if you exceed limits
- Monitor your Resend dashboard usage

---

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. ✅ **Deploy to Vercel** (or your platform)
