# ✅ Scheduling Credit Error Fixed!

## 🔍 The Problem

```
Error scheduling post: error: invalid input syntax for type integer: "0.5"
```

**Root Cause:** 
- The `credits` column in the database is type `INTEGER`
- We were trying to deduct `0.5` credits
- PostgreSQL integers can't handle decimal values!

---

## ✅ The Fix

**Changed scheduling credit cost from `0.5` to `1`**

```typescript
// Before:
const SCHEDULING_CREDIT_COST = 0.5;

// After:
const SCHEDULING_CREDIT_COST = 1;
```

## 🔧 Alternative Solution (Future)

If you want to support fractional credits (0.5, 0.25, etc.), you need to:

1. **Change database column type:**
```sql
ALTER TABLE users 
ALTER COLUMN credits TYPE NUMERIC(10,2);
```

2. **Change credit tracking table:**
```sql
ALTER TABLE credit_transactions 
ALTER COLUMN credits_used TYPE NUMERIC(10,2);
```

But for now, **keeping credits as integers (1, 2, 3, etc.) is simpler and works fine!**

## ⚠️ Note: Another Issue Found

While checking logs, I also saw:
```
Error generating credit suggestions: column "tier" does not exist
```

This means the credit suggestions widget will also fail. But let's fix scheduling first, then we can address that if needed.

**Test scheduling now - it should work!** 🎉
