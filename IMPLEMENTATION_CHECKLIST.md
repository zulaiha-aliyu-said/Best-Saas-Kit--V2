### Step 3: (Optional) Generate Test Codes
```typescript
import { createLTDCodeBatch } from '@/lib/ltd-database';

// Generate test codes for each tier
const tier1 = await createLTDCodeBatch(1, 10, 'TEST');
const tier2 = await createLTDCodeBatch(2, 10, 'TEST');
const tier3 = await createLTDCodeBatch(3, 10, 'TEST');
const tier4 = await createLTDCodeBatch(4, 10, 'TEST');

console.log('Codes generated:', tier1.map(c => c.code));
```

### Step 4: Update Navigation (Optional)
```typescript
// Add to your dashboard navigation
<NavItem href="/dashboard/ltd-pricing" icon={<Gift />}>
  Lifetime Pricing
