## 🔧 **Changes Made**

### **1. Updated Predictive Performance Modal**
**File:** `src/components/ai/predictive-performance-modal.tsx`

**Changes:**
- ✅ Added `UpgradePrompt` component import
- ✅ Added state for upgrade prompt: `showUpgrade` and `tierInfo`
- ✅ Detects tier restriction (403 response) and shows upgrade prompt
- ✅ Replaces red error box with beautiful upgrade card

**Before:**
```tsx
{error && (
  <div className="p-4 bg-red-50 border border-red-200 rounded-lg">
    <XCircle className="w-4 h-4" />
    <span>Error</span>
    <p>{error}</p>
  </div>
)}
```

**After:**
```tsx
{showUpgrade && tierInfo ? (
  <UpgradePrompt
    featureName="AI Performance Predictions"
    currentTier={tierInfo.currentTier}
    requiredTier={tierInfo.requiredTier}
    variant="inline"
    benefits={[...]}
  />
) : error && (
  <div className="p-4 bg-red-50 ...">
    {/* Only shows for real errors, not tier restrictions */}
  </div>
)}
```

### **2. Verified Style Training API**
**File:** `src/app/api/style-training/create/route.ts`

**Tier Check:**
```typescript
if (plan?.plan_type === 'ltd') {
  const userTier = plan.ltd_tier || 1;
  
  if (userTier < 3) {  // ✅ Correctly requires Tier 3+
    return NextResponse.json({
      error: 'Tier 3+ Required',
      message: '"Talk Like Me" Style Training is a Tier 3+ feature...',
      code: 'TIER_RESTRICTED',
      currentTier: userTier,
      requiredTier: 3
    }, { status: 403 });
  }
}
```

**Status:** ✅ API is correctly set to Tier 3+

### **3. Style Training Frontend**
**File:** `src/app/dashboard/style-training/page.tsx`

**Already has proper upgrade prompt:**
```tsx
if (showUpgrade && tierInfo) {
  return (
    <UpgradePrompt
      featureName='"Talk Like Me" Style Training'
      currentTier={tierInfo.currentTier}
      requiredTier={tierInfo.requiredTier}
      variant="inline"
