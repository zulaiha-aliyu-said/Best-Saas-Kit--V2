# 🔧 Viral Hooks Credit Deduction Fix

## ❌ Problem

User reported that viral hooks weren't deducting credits even though content repurposing was working correctly.

---

## 🔍 Root Cause

The viral hooks generator was calling a different API endpoint that had NO credit deduction logic:

**Endpoint:** `/api/hooks/generate`  
**Issue:** No credit checking or deduction code

**The endpoint was:**
1. ✅ Generating hooks from database patterns
2. ✅ Saving generated hooks to database
3. ❌ NOT checking user credits
4. ❌ NOT deducting credits
5. ❌ NOT logging usage

---

## ✅ Solution

Added complete LTD credit system to the viral hooks endpoint.

**File:** `src/app/api/hooks/generate/route.ts`

### Added Imports:
```typescript
import { deductCredits as deductLTDCredits, getUserPlan } from '@/lib/feature-gate';
import { calculateCreditCost } from '@/lib/ltd-tiers';
```

### Added Credit Logic:
```typescript
// Calculate credit cost (2 credits for Tier 1-3, may be discounted for Tier 4)
const plan = await getUserPlan(userId);
const creditCost = calculateCreditCost('viral_hook', plan?.ltd_tier ?? undefined);

console.log(`💳 Viral Hook Credit Calculation: ${creditCost} credits (Tier ${plan?.ltd_tier || 'free'})`);

// Check and deduct credits
const creditResult = await deductLTDCredits(
  userId,
  creditCost,
  'viral_hook',
  { topic, platform, niche }
);

// Return error if insufficient credits
if (!creditResult.success) {
  return NextResponse.json({
    error: creditResult.error || 'Insufficient credits',
    code: 'INSUFFICIENT_CREDITS',
    remaining: creditResult.remaining,
    required: creditCost
  }, { status: 402 });
}

console.log(`✅ Deducted ${creditCost} credits for viral hooks. Remaining: ${creditResult.remaining}`);
```

### Updated Response:
```typescript
return NextResponse.json({ 
  hooks,
  credits: creditResult.remaining,    // Current balance
  creditsUsed: creditCost             // Amount deducted (2 credits)
});
```
