## 🔐 Feature Gating Examples

### Server-Side Protection
```typescript
import { requireFeature, requireCredits } from '@/lib/feature-gate';

// Check feature access
await requireFeature(userId, 'viral_hooks.enabled');

// Deduct credits
const remaining = await requireCredits(userId, 'viral_hook', 2);
```

### Client-Side Check
```typescript
import { useLTDFeatures } from '@/hooks/useLTDFeatures';

const { hasFeature } = useLTDFeatures();

if (!hasFeature('viral_hooks.enabled')) {
  return <UpgradePrompt />;
}
```

## 🔄 What's NOT Included (As Per Request)

These will be added later:

- [ ] Code redemption UI/UX flow
- [ ] Code redemption API endpoint (`POST /api/ltd/redeem`)
- [ ] Admin code generator interface
- [ ] Bulk code export functionality
- [ ] Code redemption confirmation emails

**BUT:** The backend for code redemption is **fully implemented** in `src/lib/ltd-database.ts` (function `redeemLTDCode()`). You just need to build the UI!

## 💡 Key Design Decisions

### Why PostgreSQL Functions?
- Automatic credit reset without cron jobs
- Consistent business logic at DB level
- Better performance for complex queries

### Why JSONB for Features?
- Flexible feature definitions
- No schema changes for new features
- Easy feature toggles

### Why Separate Credit Log Table?
- Analytics without affecting main table
- Historical data preservation
- Better query performance

### Why Client + Server Checks?
- Client checks for UX (instant feedback)
- Server checks for security (can't be bypassed)
- Best of both worlds
