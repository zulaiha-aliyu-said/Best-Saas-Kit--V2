## 📊 How Email Tracking Works

### Send Flow:
```
1. Call sendEmail() with emailType and tags
   ↓
2. Email sent via Resend API
   ↓
3. Resend returns email_id
   ↓
4. trackEmailSent() stores in email_tracking table
   ↓
5. If part of campaign, links to campaign_id
```

### Tracking Flow:
```
User Opens Email → Resend webhook → trackEmailOpen() → Updates email_tracking table
User Clicks Link → Resend webhook → trackEmailClick() → Updates email_tracking table
```
