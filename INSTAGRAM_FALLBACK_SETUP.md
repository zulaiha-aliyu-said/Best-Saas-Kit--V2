# 🔄 Instagram API Fallback System

## 🎯 Current Situation

- **Primary API:** `instagram-profile1.p.rapidapi.com` ❌ (downtime/not working)
- **Your API:** `instagram-social-api.p.rapidapi.com` ✅ (available)
- **Endpoint you shared:** `/v1/search_coordinates` ❌ (wrong - this is for location search, not user profiles)

---

## ✅ What We Need

For competitor analysis, we need an endpoint that returns:
1. User profile (username, followers, bio, etc.)
2. User's recent posts (with likes, comments, media)

**The endpoint you shared won't work because:**
- `search_coordinates` = Find posts by GPS location
- We need: Get user profile + posts by username

---

## 🔍 Find the Correct Endpoint

### Step 1: Check Your Instagram Social API

```bash
1. Go to: https://rapidapi.com/nguyenphi2000.dev/api/instagram-social-api
   (or search "instagram-social-api" on RapidAPI)

2. Click "Endpoints" tab

3. Look for endpoints like:
   ✅ GET /v1/user/info/{username}
   ✅ GET /v1/user/feed/{username}
   ✅ GET /v1/profile/{username}
   ✅ GET /v1/user/posts/{username}
   
   ❌ NOT: /v1/search_coordinates (this is for location, not users)

4. Test the endpoint with: natgeo
   - Does it return profile data?
   - Does it return posts array?

5. Copy the endpoint URL format
```

---

## 🚀 Once You Find the Right Endpoint

### Share This Info With Me:

```json
{
  "api": "instagram-social-api.p.rapidapi.com",
  "profileEndpoint": "/v1/user/info/{username}",  ← What's the actual endpoint?
  "postsEndpoint": "/v1/user/feed/{username}",    ← Or is profile + posts in one call?
  "responseFormat": {
    ← Paste a sample response here
  }
}
```

Then I'll integrate it as a fallback!

## 💡 Alternative: I Can Help You Find a Working API

If you can't find the right endpoint, I can help you:

### Option A: Subscribe to a Different API

**Recommended Instagram APIs on RapidAPI:**

1. **Instagram Scraper API**
   - Search: "Instagram Scraper"
   - Usually has: `/user/{username}` endpoint
   - Includes profile + posts in one call

2. **Instagram API (by Social Media)**
   - Multiple endpoints for profile and posts
   - Good free tier

3. **Instagram Lookup**
   - Simple, reliable
   - Profile + recent posts

**Steps:**
```bash
1. Search RapidAPI for "Instagram API"
2. Filter by:
   - Free tier available
   - High rating (4+ stars)
   - Recent updates (not abandoned)
3. Check if it has:
   - Get user profile endpoint
   - Get user posts/feed endpoint
4. Subscribe and test with: natgeo
5. Share endpoint details with me
```

## 🔧 I'll Build a Fallback System

Once you provide the correct endpoint(s), I'll create:

```typescript
// Primary API (current)
async function fetchInstagramPrimary(username) {
  try {
    return await fetch('instagram-profile1.p.rapidapi.com/getprofile/...');
  } catch (error) {
    return null; // Fall through to fallback
  }
}

// Fallback API (your new one)
async function fetchInstagramFallback(username) {
  try {
    return await fetch('instagram-social-api.p.rapidapi.com/v1/user/...');
  } catch (error) {
    return null;
  }
}

// Main function with fallback
async function fetchInstagramCompetitor(username) {
  // Try primary first
  let data = await fetchInstagramPrimary(username);
  
  if (data && data.posts) {
    return data; // Success!
  }
  
  // Fallback to secondary
  console.log('⚠️ Primary API failed, trying fallback...');
  data = await fetchInstagramFallback(username);
  
  if (data && data.posts) {
    return data; // Fallback success!
  }
  
  // Both failed
  return null;
}
```
