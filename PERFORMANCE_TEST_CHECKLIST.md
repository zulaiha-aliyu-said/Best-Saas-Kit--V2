# Performance Testing Checklist

Use this checklist to verify all performance optimizations are working correctly.

## üß™ Testing Instructions

### Prerequisites
```bash
# Build the application
npm run build

# Start the production server
npm run start
```

---

## ‚úÖ 1. Skeleton UI Loading States

### Dashboard Pages
- [ ] Navigate to `/dashboard` - See skeleton UI immediately
- [ ] Navigate to `/dashboard/analytics` - See analytics skeleton
- [ ] Navigate to `/dashboard/billing` - See billing skeleton
- [ ] Navigate to `/dashboard/schedule` - See schedule skeleton
- [ ] Navigate to `/dashboard/repurpose` - See repurpose skeleton
- [ ] Navigate to `/dashboard/history` - See history skeleton
- [ ] Navigate to `/dashboard/trends` - See trends skeleton
- [ ] Navigate to `/dashboard/hooks` - See hooks skeleton
- [ ] Navigate to `/dashboard/settings` - See settings skeleton
- [ ] Navigate to `/dashboard/profile` - See profile skeleton
- [ ] Navigate to `/dashboard/chat` - See chat skeleton
- [ ] Navigate to `/dashboard/templates` - See templates skeleton

### Admin Pages
- [ ] Navigate to `/admin` - See admin skeleton
- [ ] Navigate to `/admin/users` - See users skeleton
- [ ] Navigate to `/admin/analytics` - See analytics skeleton

**Expected Result:** Each page shows a skeleton UI that matches the page structure while loading.

---

## ‚úÖ 2. Page Transition Loading

- [ ] Click between different dashboard pages
- [ ] Notice smooth loading overlay during navigation
- [ ] Loading spinner appears centered
- [ ] "Loading..." message displays
- [ ] Transition is smooth, not jarring

**Expected Result:** A semi-transparent overlay with spinner appears during page transitions.

---

## ‚úÖ 3. Parallel API Calls

### Test in Chrome DevTools
1. Open DevTools (F12)
2. Go to Network tab
3. Navigate to `/dashboard`
4. Check the timing of API calls

- [ ] Multiple API calls start at nearly the same time
- [ ] `/api/credits` loads in parallel
- [ ] `/api/users/stats` loads in parallel
- [ ] `/api/history` loads in parallel
- [ ] `/api/trends` loads in parallel

**Expected Result:** All API calls initiate simultaneously (waterfall shows parallel requests, not sequential).

---

## ‚úÖ 4. Caching

### First Visit
1. Clear browser cache (Ctrl+Shift+Delete)
2. Navigate to `/dashboard`
3. Note the API call times in Network tab

### Second Visit
4. Refresh the page (F5)
5. Check Network tab again

- [ ] Cached responses load faster
- [ ] Some requests show "from memory cache" or "from disk cache"
- [ ] Response times are significantly reduced

**Expected Result:** Second load is much faster due to caching.

---

## ‚úÖ 5. Image Optimization

### Test with DevTools
1. Open Network tab
2. Filter by "Img"
3. Navigate to pages with images

- [ ] Images load lazily (only when scrolled into view)
- [ ] Modern formats used (WebP or AVIF)
- [ ] Skeleton appears before image loads
- [ ] Images fade in smoothly
- [ ] No layout shift when images load

**Expected Result:** Images use modern formats and load efficiently.

---

## ‚úÖ 6. Slow Network Performance

### Simulate Slow Connection
1. Open DevTools (F12)
2. Go to Network tab
3. Set throttling to "Slow 3G"
4. Navigate around the site

- [ ] Skeleton UI appears immediately
- [ ] Page structure is visible instantly
- [ ] Loading states provide feedback
- [ ] Site remains usable during load
- [ ] No blank screens or confusion

**Expected Result:** Even on slow 3G, the site feels responsive with skeleton UI.

---

## ‚úÖ 7. Bundle Size & Code Splitting

### Check Bundle Analysis
```bash
npm run build
```

Look at the build output:

- [ ] Build output shows multiple smaller chunks
- [ ] Page-specific bundles are created
- [ ] Shared chunks are optimized
- [ ] Total bundle size is reasonable

**Expected Result:** Build creates optimized chunks, not one massive bundle.

---

## ‚úÖ 8. Font Loading

### Visual Check
1. Hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R)
2. Watch for font loading

- [ ] No "flash of unstyled text" (FOUT)
- [ ] Fonts load smoothly
- [ ] Text displays immediately with swap strategy

**Expected Result:** Fonts load without jarring visual changes.

---

## ‚úÖ 9. Mobile Performance

### Test on Mobile or DevTools Device Emulation
1. Open DevTools
2. Toggle device toolbar (Ctrl+Shift+M)
3. Select a mobile device
4. Navigate the site

- [ ] Pages load quickly on mobile
- [ ] Touch interactions are smooth
- [ ] Images are appropriately sized
- [ ] Layout doesn't shift

**Expected Result:** Mobile experience is fast and smooth.

---

## ‚úÖ 10. Error Handling

### Test Failed API Calls
1. Turn off internet connection
2. Try navigating/refreshing
3. Or modify API route to return error

- [ ] Error states display gracefully
- [ ] No blank screens
- [ ] User-friendly error messages
- [ ] Retry options available

**Expected Result:** Errors are handled gracefully without breaking UI.

---

## üìä Performance Metrics

### Lighthouse Audit
1. Open Chrome DevTools
2. Go to Lighthouse tab
3. Select "Performance" and "Best Practices"
4. Generate report

**Target Scores:**
- [ ] Performance: 90+ 
- [ ] Best Practices: 95+
- [ ] Accessibility: 90+
- [ ] SEO: 90+

### Core Web Vitals
- [ ] LCP (Largest Contentful Paint) < 2.5s
- [ ] FID (First Input Delay) < 100ms
- [ ] CLS (Cumulative Layout Shift) < 0.1

---

## üêõ Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: Skeleton doesn't show
**Solution:** Check if `loading.tsx` exists in the route folder

### Issue: API calls still sequential
**Solution:** Verify `Promise.allSettled` is being used

### Issue: Cache not working
**Solution:** Check cache headers in API routes and browser settings

### Issue: Images still slow
**Solution:** Ensure using `OptimizedImage` component, not native `<img>`

### Issue: Bundle size too large
**Solution:** Check for unnecessary imports, enable code splitting

## ‚ú® Quick Performance Test

Run this quick test to verify everything works:

1. **Clear cache** (Ctrl+Shift+Delete)
2. **Open DevTools** (F12)
3. **Go to Network tab**

## üìà Before vs After Comparison

### Metrics to Compare

| Metric | Before | After | Target |
|--------|--------|-------|--------|
| Dashboard Load Time | 3-4s | 1-2s | < 2s ‚úÖ |
| Time to Interactive | 4-5s | 1.5-2.5s | < 3s ‚úÖ |
| Bundle Size | Large | Optimized | Smaller ‚úÖ |
| API Calls | Serial | Parallel | Parallel ‚úÖ |
| Cache Hit Rate | 0% | ~80% | > 50% ‚úÖ |
| Skeleton UI | None | All pages | All pages ‚úÖ |
