# ✅ Settings Page - Writing Style Access Fix

## Issue

User had old style profiles created **before tier-gating** was implemented. They could still access the "Writing Style" tab in Settings even when on Tier 2 (should be Tier 3+ only).

---

## Root Cause

The Settings page (`src/app/dashboard/settings/page.tsx`) had:
- ❌ **No tier checking** before showing the Writing Style tab
- ❌ **Always displayed** the tab in the navigation
- ❌ **Always rendered** the style components (StyleProfileComponent, StyleTrainingComponent, StyleTestComponent)

This meant users with old style profiles could bypass tier restrictions.

---

## Solution

### 1. **Added Tier State & Fetching**

```typescript
const [userTier, setUserTier] = useState<number>(1);

useEffect(() => {
  loadPreferences();
  fetchUserTier(); // ✅ Added
}, []);

const fetchUserTier = async () => {
  const response = await fetch('/api/user/tier');
  const data = await response.json();
  setUserTier(data.tier || 1);
};
```

### 2. **Conditionally Hide Writing Style Tab**

```typescript
<TabsList className={`grid w-full ${userTier >= 3 ? 'grid-cols-7' : 'grid-cols-6'}`}>
  {/* ... other tabs ... */}
  
  {userTier >= 3 && (
    <TabsTrigger value="style" className="flex items-center gap-2">
      <PenTool className="h-4 w-4" />
      Writing Style
      <Badge className="ml-1 bg-purple-600 text-[10px] px-1 py-0">Tier 3+</Badge>
    </TabsTrigger>
  )}
  
  {/* ... other tabs ... */}
</TabsList>
```

**What Changed:**
- Tab grid dynamically adjusts: **6 columns** (Tier 1-2) vs **7 columns** (Tier 3+)
- Writing Style tab **only appears** for Tier 3+ users
- Added visible **Tier 3+ badge** on the tab

### 3. **Replace Content with Upgrade Prompt**

```typescript
{/* Writing Style */}
{userTier >= 3 ? (
  <TabsContent value="style" className="space-y-6">
    <div className="space-y-6">
      <StyleProfileComponent />
      <StyleTrainingComponent />
      <StyleTestComponent />
    </div>
  </TabsContent>
) : (
  <TabsContent value="style" className="space-y-6">
    <Card>
      <CardContent className="pt-6">
        <UpgradePrompt
          featureName='"Talk Like Me" Style Training'
          currentTier={userTier}
          requiredTier={3}
          variant="inline"
          benefits={[
            "AI learns your unique writing voice",
            "Generate content that sounds like you",
            "1 style profile (Tier 3), 3 profiles (Tier 4)",
            "Maintain brand consistency across platforms",
            "750 credits/month (Tier 3)"
          ]}
        />
      </CardContent>
    </Card>
  </TabsContent>
)}
```

**What Changed:**
- Tier 3+: Shows full style training components
- Tier 1-2: Shows beautiful upgrade prompt instead

### 4. **Added Import**

```typescript
import { UpgradePrompt } from "@/components/upgrade/UpgradePrompt";
```

---

## Files Modified

1. **`src/app/dashboard/settings/page.tsx`**
   - Added `userTier` state
   - Added `fetchUserTier()` function
   - Conditionally render Writing Style tab
   - Added UpgradePrompt for Tier 1-2 users
   - Added UpgradePrompt import

---

## What Users See Now

### **Tier 1-2 Users**
- ❌ **Writing Style tab is hidden** from settings navigation
- ❌ **Cannot access** old style profiles
- ✅ **If they had bookmarked** the direct URL (`/dashboard/settings?tab=style`), they'll see an upgrade prompt
- 🎨 **Beautiful upgrade message** encouraging them to upgrade

### **Tier 3+ Users**
- ✅ **Writing Style tab appears** in navigation
- ✅ **See "Tier 3+" badge** on the tab
- ✅ **Full access** to all style training features
- ✅ **Can see and use** old profiles
- ✅ **Can create** new profiles

---

## Additional Context

### Related Fixes

This fix completes the style training tier-gating across **all entry points**:

1. ✅ **`/dashboard/style-training`** page - Already fixed (shows upgrade prompt)
2. ✅ **`/dashboard/settings?tab=style`** tab - **NOW FIXED** (tab hidden + upgrade prompt)
3. ✅ **API endpoints** - Already secured (Tier 3+ check)

### Data Preservation

**Important:** Old style profiles are **NOT deleted** from the database. They are simply hidden from Tier 1-2 users. If a user upgrades to Tier 3+:

- ✅ Old profiles will reappear automatically
- ✅ All style data is preserved
- ✅ No data migration needed

---

## Testing

### Test as Tier 2 User:
1. Sign in as `mamutech.online@gmail.com` (Tier 2)
2. Go to `/dashboard/settings`
3. **Expected:** Only see 6 tabs (no Writing Style tab)
4. Try visiting `/dashboard/settings?tab=style` directly
5. **Expected:** See upgrade prompt (not style components)

### Test as Tier 3+ User:
1. Sign in as a Tier 3+ user
2. Go to `/dashboard/settings`
3. **Expected:** See 7 tabs including "Writing Style" with Tier 3+ badge
4. Click Writing Style tab
5. **Expected:** See all style components and old profiles

## Summary

✅ **Writing Style is now fully tier-gated in Settings**  
✅ **Old profiles are hidden for Tier 1-2 users**  
✅ **Beautiful upgrade prompts replace error messages**  
✅ **Tab navigation adjusts dynamically**  
✅ **User data is preserved for future upgrades**  

🎉 **The tier-gating is now complete across all entry points!**
