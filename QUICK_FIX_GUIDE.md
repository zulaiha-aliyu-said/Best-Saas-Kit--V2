# 🔧 Quick Fix Guide - Common Issues

## ✅ Issue: `toFixed is not a function` - FIXED!

### **What Happened:**
PostgreSQL `DECIMAL` fields return as **strings**, not numbers. The code was trying to call `.toFixed()` on a string.

### **The Fix:**
✅ Already implemented in all files using `formatEngagementRate()` helper function

### **Solution Applied:**
1. ✅ Cleared stale build cache (`.next` folder)
2. ✅ Restarted dev server with fresh build
3. ✅ All code already uses correct helper function

---

## 🎯 Current Status

### **All Fixed:**
- ✅ `CompetitorCard.tsx` - Uses `formatEngagementRate()`
- ✅ `AnalysisDashboard.tsx` - Uses `formatEngagementRate()`
- ✅ Helper function handles string/number/null/undefined

### **Helper Function:**
```typescript
// src/utils/competitorHelpers.ts
export const formatEngagementRate = (rate: number | string | null | undefined): string => {
  if (rate === null || rate === undefined) return '0.00';
  
  const numRate = typeof rate === 'string' ? parseFloat(rate) : rate;
  
  if (isNaN(numRate)) return '0.00';
  
  return numRate.toFixed(2);
};
```

## 🧪 Test Now

### **Step 1: Refresh Page**
```
1. Go to http://localhost:3000/dashboard/competitors
2. Hard refresh: Ctrl+Shift+R (or Cmd+Shift+R on Mac)
3. Error should be gone!
```

### **Step 2: Verify Analytics**
```
1. Click "View Analysis" on any competitor
2. Open Browser Console (F12)
3. Check for debug logs:
   - [Analytics] Posts found: X
   - [AdvancedAnalytics] API Response: {...}
   - [PerformanceCharts] Received data: {...}
```

### **Step 3: Check Real Data**
Look for these in console:
```javascript
[Analytics] Posts found: 24  // ← Should match terminal log
[AdvancedAnalytics] Setting analytics data: {...}
[PerformanceCharts] postingPatternLength: 7  // ← Real data!
```

## 🔍 If You Still See Mock Data

The `toFixed` error was masking the real issue. Now that it's fixed, if you still see mock data (20,200 posts), check:

### **1. Database Has Posts**
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM competitor_posts;
-- Should be > 0
```

### **2. Posts Match Competitor**
```sql
SELECT c.name, COUNT(cp.id) as posts
FROM competitors c
LEFT JOIN competitor_posts cp ON c.id = cp.competitor_id
GROUP BY c.name;
-- Should show posts for each competitor
```

### **3. Check Console Logs**
With the new debug logging, you'll see:
- How many posts were found
- If analytics data is being passed
- If components receive the data

---

## 🚀 What to Expect Now

### **Before (Error):**
```
❌ TypeError: toFixed is not a function
❌ Page crashes
❌ Can't view competitors
```

### **After (Fixed):**
```
✅ Competitors page loads
✅ Can view analysis
✅ Engagement rates display correctly
✅ Real data flows through (if posts exist in DB)
```

---

## 📊 Debugging Real vs Mock Data

### **Check 1: Browser Console**
```javascript
// Look for these logs:
[Analytics] Posts found: 24
[AdvancedAnalytics] hasAnalytics: true
[PerformanceCharts] postingPatternLength: 7

// If you see:
[Analytics] Posts found: 0
// → Posts aren't in database
```

### **Check 2: Network Tab**
```
1. Open DevTools → Network tab
2. Refresh analytics page
3. Find request: competitors/[id]/analytics
4. Check Response tab
5. Look for "postingPattern" array with 7 items
```

### **Check 3: Database**
```sql
-- Get competitor ID from browser URL
-- Then check:
SELECT * FROM competitor_posts 
WHERE competitor_id = 'YOUR_ID'
LIMIT 5;

-- If empty → posts weren't stored during analysis
-- If has data → data flow issue (check logs)
```

## 🎉 Summary

### **What Was Fixed:**
1. ✅ `.toFixed()` error on engagement_rate
2. ✅ Cleared build cache
3. ✅ Restarted dev server
4. ✅ Added debug logging throughout

### **What to Do Next:**
1. 🔄 Refresh your browser (hard refresh)
2. 🔍 Check browser console for new logs
3. 📊 View analytics and see what logs say
4. 📸 Share screenshot of console if still seeing mock data

## 🛠️ Quick Commands Reference

### **Clear Cache & Restart:**
```powershell
# PowerShell
Remove-Item -Recurse -Force .next
npm run dev
```

### **Check Database:**
```sql
-- Count all posts
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM competitor_posts;

-- Posts per competitor
SELECT c.name, COUNT(cp.id) 
FROM competitors c
LEFT JOIN competitor_posts cp ON c.id = cp.competitor_id
GROUP BY c.name;
```

### **Hard Refresh Browser:**
```
Windows: Ctrl + Shift + R
Mac: Cmd + Shift + R
Or: Ctrl + F5
```
