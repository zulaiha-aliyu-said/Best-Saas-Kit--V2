# Repurpose Form Toggle Functionality Update

## Changes Made

### 1. Frontend State Management (page.tsx)
- Added `includeEmojis` state (default: `false`)
- Added `includeCTA` state (default: `false`)
- Connected switches to state with `checked` and `onCheckedChange` props
- Simplified API call to use state values directly instead of DOM queries

### 2. Backend Prompt Enhancement (route.ts)
Enhanced AI prompt instructions for better clarity:

**Hashtags:**
- When ON: "‚úÖ Include 3-5 relevant hashtags at the end"
- When OFF: "‚ùå DO NOT include any hashtags"

**Emojis:**
- When ON: "üòä Use 1-3 relevant emojis per post to add personality and engagement"
- When OFF: "‚ùå DO NOT include any emojis"

**Call-to-Action:**
- When ON: "üì¢ End each post with a clear call-to-action (e.g., 'Comment below', 'Share your thoughts', 'Learn more at...', 'Try it today')"
- When OFF: "‚ùå DO NOT include any call-to-action"

## How It Works

1. **User toggles switches** in the repurpose form
2. **State updates** (`includeEmojis`, `includeCTA`) trigger re-render
3. **On submit**, state values are sent to API in `options` object:
   ```json
   {
     "includeHashtags": true/false,
     "includeEmojis": true/false,
     "includeCTA": true/false
   }
   ```
4. **Backend constructs prompt** with explicit instructions based on toggle values
5. **AI generates content** following the specified constraints
6. **Output respects** user preferences for emojis and CTAs

## Testing

To test the functionality:

1. Go to `/dashboard/repurpose`
2. Toggle "Include emojis" ON ‚Üí Generated posts should contain 1-3 emojis
3. Toggle "Include emojis" OFF ‚Üí Generated posts should have NO emojis
4. Toggle "Include call-to-action" ON ‚Üí Posts should end with CTAs like "Comment below", "Share your thoughts"
5. Toggle "Include call-to-action" OFF ‚Üí Posts should NOT have CTAs
6. Toggle "Include hashtags" ON/OFF ‚Üí Should add/remove hashtags accordingly

## Default Values

- **Include hashtags**: ON (default)
- **Include emojis**: OFF (default)
- **Include call-to-action**: OFF (default)

This ensures a professional default while giving users full control over post styling.
