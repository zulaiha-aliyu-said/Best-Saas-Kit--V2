## 💡 Bonus Improvements Made

### Upgrade Card Enhancement

Changed the sidebar upgrade card to promote LTD instead of Pro subscription:
- **Old:** "Upgrade to Pro" → generic subscription
- **New:** "🎁 Lifetime Deal" → promotes AppSumo LTD
- **Price Hook:** "from just $59" → creates urgency
- **Link:** Now goes to LTD pricing instead of billing

This creates a clear funnel: **Dashboard → Upgrade Card → LTD Pricing → Purchase**
