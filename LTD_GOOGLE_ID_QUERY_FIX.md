# 🔧 Google ID Query Fix - "User not found" Error

## ❌ Problem

User was getting "Generation Error: User not found" even though they were created successfully.

**Terminal showed:**
```
✅ User created successfully: saasmamu@gmail.com
...
userId: 946  ← Old numeric ID!
POST /api/repurpose 402 in 11176ms
```

**Root Cause:**
The user had:
- `id`: "946" (old numeric primary key)
- `google_id`: "105690124243431155083" (actual Google ID)

These didn't match because this was an existing user from before we migrated to VARCHAR IDs.

---

## ✅ Solution

### Fixed `getUserByGoogleId` Function
**File:** `src/lib/database.ts`

Changed the query from searching by `id` to searching by `google_id`:

**Before (Broken):**
```typescript
// Query by id (primary key) for better performance
const query = 'SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = $1'
```

**After (Fixed):**
```typescript
// Query by google_id to handle both old numeric IDs and new VARCHAR IDs
const query = 'SELECT * FROM users WHERE google_id = $1'
```

## 🎯 Why This Works

### The Issue:
1. Old users have `id` ≠ `google_id` (like id="946", google_id="105690124243431155083")
2. New users have `id` = `google_id` (both are the Google ID string)
3. Code was querying `WHERE id = $1` with the Google ID
4. For old users, this didn't match because id="946" not "105690124243431155083"

### The Fix:
- Query by `google_id` column instead
- Works for BOTH old and new users
- `google_id` column always contains the actual Google OAuth ID
- No need to migrate existing data

## 📊 Database State

### Your Current User:
```sql
SELECT id, google_id, email, plan_type, ltd_tier, credits
FROM users 
WHERE email = 'saasmamu@gmail.com';
```

**Result:**
| id | google_id | email | plan_type | ltd_tier | credits |
|----|-----------|-------|-----------|----------|---------|
| 946 | 105690124243431155083 | saasmamu@gmail.com | ltd | 3 | 746 |

✅ **You're already set up with LTD Tier 3!**
- 750 credits/month
- 746 credits remaining
- All Tier 3 features enabled

## 🎉 What's Fixed

1. ✅ **`getUserByGoogleId` now works** for old users (id ≠ google_id)
2. ✅ **Still works** for new users (id = google_id)
3. ✅ **No data migration needed** - backward compatible
4. ✅ **User can generate content** - credits will deduct properly

## 🔄 Test It Now

1. **Refresh the page** (Ctrl+R)
2. Go to `/dashboard/repurpose`
3. Select platforms (e.g., Twitter, LinkedIn, Instagram)
4. Generate content
5. ✅ **Should work!**

### Expected Terminal Output:
```
🗄️  database.ts - getUserPreferences
  userId: 946
💳 Credit calculation: 3 platforms × 1 credits = 3 total credits
✅ Deducted 3 credits. Remaining: 743
POST /api/repurpose 200 in 5000ms ✅
```

## 💡 Future Users

For NEW users signing in for the first time:
- `upsertUser` sets `id = google_id`
- Both columns will have the same value
- No issues with lookups

For EXISTING users (like you):
- `id` remains old numeric value (946)
- `google_id` has the actual Google ID
- Query by `google_id` finds them correctly
