# Ayrshare Basic Plan Limitations & Local Scheduling Solution

## 🔍 **Ayrshare Basic Plan Limitations**

Unfortunately, the Ayrshare Basic (Free) Plan has significant limitations:

### **❌ What's NOT Available with Basic Plan:**
1. **`/profiles` endpoint** - Cannot fetch connected accounts (requires Business Plan)
2. **`/post` endpoint** - Cannot schedule or publish posts (requires Premium or Business Plan)
3. **Account management** - Cannot programmatically manage social accounts
4. **Post scheduling** - Cannot use Ayrshare API for scheduling

### **Ayrshare Plan Requirements:**
- **Basic (Free)**: Very limited - mainly for testing API connectivity
- **Premium ($20/month)**: Enables `/post` endpoint for scheduling
- **Business ($99/month)**: Full API access including account management
