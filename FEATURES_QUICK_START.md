## üéØ Your Next Steps

### Step 1: View What's Been Created (2 min)

Start your dev server and check out the pages:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Then visit:
- **Main Page:** http://localhost:3000/features

### Step 2: Create Remaining Feature Pages (3-4 hours)

You have **12 more features** to create. Here's the fastest way:

#### Quick Copy-Paste Template

For each remaining feature, create a new file and use this template:

**File:** `src/app/features/[feature-slug]/page.tsx`

```typescript
import { FeatureDetailTemplate } from "@/components/features/FeatureDetailTemplate";
import { YourIcon, Clock, Brain, Target, Zap } from "lucide-react";

export const metadata = {
  title: 'Your Feature | Features | RepurposeAI',
  description: 'Your SEO description here',
};

export default function YourFeaturePage() {
  return (
    <FeatureDetailTemplate
      badge="Your Badge"
      badgeColor="bg-purple-600"
      title="Your Feature Title"
      description="Your comprehensive description explaining what this feature does, why it's valuable, and how it helps users achieve their content goals."
      heroIcon={YourIcon}
      heroGradient="from-purple-500 to-pink-500"
      ctaPrimary="Try Feature Now"
      ctaPrimaryLink="/dashboard/your-feature"

      benefits={[
        {
          icon: Clock,
          title: "Benefit 1 Title",
          description: "Benefit 1 description explaining the value"
        },
        {
          icon: Brain,
          title: "Benefit 2 Title",
          description: "Benefit 2 description explaining the value"
        },
        {
          icon: Target,
          title: "Benefit 3 Title",
          description: "Benefit 3 description explaining the value"
        },
        {
          icon: Zap,
          title: "Benefit 4 Title",
          description: "Benefit 4 description explaining the value"
        }
      ]}

      howItWorks={[
        {
          step: "1",
          title: "First Step",
          description: "What happens in step one"
        },
        {
          step: "2",
          title: "Second Step",
          description: "What happens in step two"
        },
        {
          step: "3",
          title: "Third Step",
          description: "What happens in step three"
        },
        {
          step: "4",
          title: "Fourth Step",
          description: "What happens in step four"
        }
      ]}

      features={[
        "Feature point 1",
        "Feature point 2",
        "Feature point 3",
        "Feature point 4",
        "Feature point 5",
        "Feature point 6",
        "Feature point 7",
        "Feature point 8",
        "Feature point 9",
        "Feature point 10",
        "Feature point 11",
        "Feature point 12",
      ]}

      useCases={[
        { title: "Use Case 1", description: "Description 1" },
        { title: "Use Case 2", description: "Description 2" },
        { title: "Use Case 3", description: "Description 3" },
        { title: "Use Case 4", description: "Description 4" },
        { title: "Use Case 5", description: "Description 5" },
        { title: "Use Case 6", description: "Description 6" },
      ]}

      ctaTitle="Ready to Get Started?"
      ctaDescription="Start using this feature today to boost your productivity."
    />
  );

```
