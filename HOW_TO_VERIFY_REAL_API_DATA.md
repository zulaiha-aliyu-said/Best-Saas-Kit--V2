# How to Verify Real API Data is Being Fetched

## 🔍 Visual Indicators in the UI

### 1. **Source Badges on Each Trend Card**
Each trend card now shows where the data came from:
- 🔴 **Reddit** - Data from Reddit API
- 📰 **News** - Data from News API  
- 🔍 **Google** - Data from Google Trends
- 📝 **Curated** - Fallback mock data

**Look for these badges** on each trend card to see the source!

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### "⚠️ Credentials not configured"
- **Fix**: Add API keys to `.env.local`
- **Restart**: Server after adding keys

### "❌ Error: Invalid credentials"
- **Fix**: Double-check API keys are correct
- **Test**: Keys directly on API provider websites

### "Using fallback mock data"
- **Cause**: All APIs failed or no keys configured
- **Result**: App still works with curated data
- **Fix**: Configure at least one API

### No console logs at all
- **Fix**: Check browser console is open
- **Fix**: Clear console and try again
- **Fix**: Check server terminal for errors

---

## 📈 Expected Behavior

### With All APIs Configured:
- **20 trends** total (10 Reddit + 10 News + 10 Google, top 20 by engagement)
- **Source badges** on all cards
- **Fresh content** every 30 minutes
- **Console logs** showing success

### With Some APIs Configured:
- **10-20 trends** (depending on which APIs work)
- **Mixed source badges**
- **Partial fresh content**

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Check Server Terminal Too**
   - Server-side logs appear in your terminal
   - Look for the same emoji logs

2. **Test One API at a Time**
   - Add Reddit keys first, test
   - Then add News key, test
   - Verify Google Trends works (no key needed)

3. **Clear Cache**
   - Cache lasts 30 minutes
   - Click "Refresh Trends" to bypass cache
   - Or restart server to clear cache

4. **Monitor Rate Limits**
   - News API: 100 requests/day (free tier)
   - Reddit API: 60 requests/minute
   - Google Trends: No official limits
