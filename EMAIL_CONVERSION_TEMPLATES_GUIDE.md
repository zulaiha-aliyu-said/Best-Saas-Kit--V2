### Email Triggers (Database Events):

```sql
-- Track user activity
CREATE TABLE email_automation (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  email_type VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
  sent_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  opened_at TIMESTAMP,
  clicked_at TIMESTAMP,
  status VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'sent'
);

-- Track credit usage for warnings
CREATE TRIGGER credit_warning_trigger
AFTER UPDATE ON users
FOR EACH ROW
WHEN (NEW.credits <= 2 AND OLD.credits > 2)
EXECUTE FUNCTION send_credit_warning_email();
```

### Email Sending Logic:

```typescript
// src/lib/email-automation.ts
export async function checkAndSendAutomationEmails() {
  // Check for users needing onboarding emails
  const inactiveNewUsers = await getInactiveNewUsers(24); // 24 hours
  
  // Check for users with low credits
  const lowCreditUsers = await getUsersWithLowCredits(2);
  
  // Check for inactive users
  const dormantUsers = await getInactiveUsers(14); // 14 days
  
  // Send appropriate emails
  for (const user of inactiveNewUsers) {
    await sendOnboardingEmail(user);
  }
  
  // ... etc
}
```
