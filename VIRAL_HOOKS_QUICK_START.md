# Viral Hook Generator - Quick Start Guide

## üöÄ Quick Setup (5 Minutes)

### Step 1: Setup Database

Run these SQL files in your PostgreSQL database:

```bash
# Navigate to your project directory
cd /path/to/Best-Saas-Kit--V2

# Run schema creation
psql -U your_username -d your_database -f sql-queries/11-create-viral-hooks-schema.sql

# Insert 500+ hook patterns
psql -U your_username -d your_database -f sql-queries/12-insert-hook-patterns.sql
```

**Alternative: Manual SQL Execution**

If you prefer to run SQL manually:
1. Open your PostgreSQL client (pgAdmin, DBeaver, etc.)
2. Connect to your database
3. Execute `sql-queries/11-create-viral-hooks-schema.sql`
4. Execute `sql-queries/12-insert-hook-patterns.sql`

### Step 2: Verify Installation

Run this query to confirm patterns are loaded:

```sql
SELECT 
  platform, 
  niche, 
  COUNT(*) as pattern_count,
  AVG(base_engagement_score) as avg_score
FROM hook_patterns 
GROUP BY platform, niche 
ORDER BY platform, niche;
```

You should see results like:
```
 platform  |   niche    | pattern_count | avg_score
-----------+------------+---------------+-----------
 email     | newsletter |     20        |   86.50
 email     | sales      |     20        |   88.25
