---

## 🧪 Testing the Welcome Email

### Method 1: Preview in Browser

1. Start your dev server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

2. Open your browser and go to:
```
http://localhost:3000/api/emails/test-welcome
```

This will show you the HTML preview of the welcome email.

---

### Method 2: Send Test Email

**Using curl:**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/emails/test-welcome \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "testEmail": "your-email@example.com",
    "userName": "John Doe"
  }'
```

**Using Postman or Thunder Client:**
```
POST http://localhost:3000/api/emails/test-welcome
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "testEmail": "your-email@example.com",
  "userName": "Test User"
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Test welcome email sent successfully",
  "emailId": "abc123..."
}
```

---

### Method 3: Real User Signup Test

1. Sign out of your app (if signed in)
2. Clear your browser cookies/session
3. Go to `/auth/signin`
4. Sign in with a NEW Google account (one that hasn't signed in before)
5. Check the email inbox for that account

**Note:** The email will only be sent for FIRST-TIME users. If the user already exists in the database, no welcome email is sent.

## ⚠️ Troubleshooting

### Email Not Sending?

1. **Check Resend API Key:**
```bash
echo $RESEND_API_KEY
```

2. **Check console logs:**
```
Welcome email sent to user@example.com
```
OR
```
Failed to send welcome email: [error message]
```

3. **Verify domain in Resend:**
   - Go to https://resend.com/domains
   - Ensure your domain is verified

### Email Going to Spam?

- Add SPF and DKIM records in your DNS
- Warm up your sending domain gradually
- Test with different email providers
