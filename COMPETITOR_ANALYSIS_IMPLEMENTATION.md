- React state for UI updates
- Proper error handling

### Data Structure
```typescript
interface Competitor {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  platform: 'twitter' | 'linkedin' | 'instagram';
  username: string;
  industry: string;
  notes?: string;
  addedDate: number;
  lastAnalyzed: number;
  stats: CompetitorStats;
  contentBreakdown: ContentTopic[];
  postingPattern: { byDay, byTime };
  formatPerformance: FormatPerformance[];
  topPosts: TopPost[];
  contentGaps: ContentGap[];
  trendingTopics: TrendingTopic[];
  aiInsights: string[];
}
```

### Styling Approach
- Tailwind CSS utility classes
- Custom gradients (purple-to-pink)
- CSS animations in globals.css
- Responsive breakpoints
- Dark mode compatible

### Performance Optimizations
- Lazy loading of charts
- Memoized calculations
- Optimized re-renders
- Skeleton loading states
- Code splitting

## 🎨 Design System

### Colors
```
Primary Gradient: from-purple-600 to-pink-600
Success: green-500
Warning: yellow-500
Error: red-500
Background: gray-50
Cards: white with shadow
Text: gray-900 (headings), gray-600 (body)
```

### Components Used
- Recharts for charts
- Lucide React for icons
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Sonner for toasts
- Custom modal components

### Animations
- `animate-fadeIn` - 300ms ease-in-out

- `animate-pulse` - Loading skeletons
- `animate-spin` - Loading spinners

## 🔧 Mock Data Implementation
