## ⚡ Pro Tips for Beginners

### 1. Start Small
Don't track 10 competitors on day one. Start with 3:
- 1 direct competitor (same size as you)
- 1 aspirational account (where you want to be)
- 1 industry leader (learn from the best)

### 2. Focus on Gaps
Not all insights are equal. Prioritize:
- 🔥 High potential gaps
- Topics with low competition
- Formats you can actually create

### 3. Test and Learn
- Try one insight at a time
- Track what works for you
- Not everything that works for competitors will work for you
- Adapt, don't copy

### 4. Use the Integration
The Competitor Insights widget on the Repurpose page:
- Shows hot topics
- Displays high-priority gaps
- Lets you act quickly on opportunities

### 5. Refresh Regularly
- Refresh analysis weekly
- Trends change fast
- What worked last month might not work now

## 📊 Reading the Charts

### Pie Chart (Content Breakdown)
- **Bigger slice** = They post about it more
- **Look for**: Their top topic (usually has highest engagement)
- **Action**: Consider similar topics

### Bar Chart (Posting Pattern)
- **Tallest bar** = Their most active day
- **Look for**: Days with high engagement
- **Action**: Test posting on those days

### Horizontal Bars (Format Performance)
- **Longest bar** = Most used format
- **Look for**: Format with highest engagement (marked 🔥)
- **Action**: Try that format

## ❓ Common Questions

### "Why mock data?"
We're currently using mock data for demonstration. Real API integration coming soon. All functionality works - you're just seeing example data.

### "How many competitors should I track?"
Start with 3-5. More doesn't always mean better. Focus on quality over quantity.

### "How often should I check?"
Weekly is good for most creators. Daily if you're in a fast-moving niche.

### "What if I don't see gaps?"
- Your niche might be saturated (good problem!)
- Try analyzing different competitors
- Look at different platforms
- Consider adjacent niches

### "Can I track myself?"
Yes! It's a great way to:
- See your own patterns
- Benchmark against competitors
- Find your content gaps
